### Security (证券)

Financial instrument that has some type of monetary value. Some popular securities are stock, bond and options. Security can be classified into three broad types

- Debt Security (债权证券)
    - Debt Security represents the money owed and must be repaid like government or corporate bonds
- Derivative Securities (衍生债券)
    - values depends on other assets
        - Options
            - Option is a contract that gives the buyer the right, but not the obligation to buy or sell underlying assets at a specificed price on a specified date. A good example would be the employee stock options.
        - Future Contracts
            - A future contract obligates the buyer to buy or seller to sell an asset at a predetermined price at a specified time in the future.
- Equity Securities (股权证券)

### Market Mechanics

- Stock Exchange，股票交易所，比如上交所，纽交所
- Broker 券商
- Market Maker 做市商，理论上买卖双方通过券商进行股票交易，但实际上买卖的股票均来自做市商。有些券商也具有做市商的资质，因此我们买的股票实际上是券商提前买好的，再卖给我们。可见，这中间是有套利空间的。
- Liquidity
    - The ability to trade an asset at a stable price. 
    - 市场流通性通常简称流通性或流动性，是指资产能够以一个合理的价格顺利变现的能力
    - Cash is considered the most liquid asset, because it can be readily traded for other assets. This might not be intuitive, but it helps to think about cash as a financial instrument like any other. Changing currency values can make it worth more or less, just like stocks, but usually the value of cash reduces over time due to inflation.
