### Use Metal2 for Computing

Wrappers around data buffer,supports float32, float16, int8, binary

- MPSVector
    - Interprets data in MTLBuffer as a 1D array
- MPSMatrix
    - Interprets data in MTLBuffer as a 2D array
    - Row-major order
- MPSTemorary Matrix
    - Allocated from MTLHeap
    - USe for most of your intermediate matrices
- Matrix-Matrix and Matrix-Vector Multiplication
    - APIs are modeled after standard BLAS GEMM and GEMV interfaces
- Triangular Matrix Factorization and Linear Solvers
    - API modeled after standard LAPACK decomposition and solve interfaces
- NN Graph API
    - Easy to parallelize between CPU and GPU
    - Fuse graph nodes
    - Execute graph nodes concurrently

    ```swift
    let conv1 = MPSCNNConvolutionNode(source: MPSNNImageNode(handle: nil), 
                                    weights: MyWeights(file:"conv1.dat"))
    ```
    - Just-in-time loading and purging of weights data
    - Minimize memory footprint

    ```swift
    class MyWeights: NSObject, MPSCNNConvolutionDataSource {
        init(file: string) {...}

        public func load() -> Bool {...}
        ...
        public func purge(){...}
    }
    ```
    - Execute graph on GPU asynchronously 

    ```swift
    // Metal Setup
    let device = MTLCreateSystemDefaultDevice()!

    // init graph
    let graph = MPSNNGraph(devcie: device, resultImage: makeGraph())

    //Create input image
    let input = MPSImage(texture: texture, ...)

    //Encode graph
    let output = graph?.executeAsync(sourceImages: [input]) {
        resultImage, error in 

        //check for error and use resultImage inside closure
    }

    //Don't wait, encode new GPU task
    ```
- LSTM APIs


### Metal for Accelerating Machine Learning

- Add GPU support for training
- CNN Inference Enhancements
    - Use FP16 accumulation
    - Available with Apple A11 Bionic GPU 
    - Delivers better performance than fp32
