### Motivation

From today we're going to learn some Philosophy, more specifically, the western Philosophy. But before we dive into the history, we have to ask ourselves why Philosophy matters? Why we care about it? 

### Glossary 

- **Metaphysics(形而上学)**, The branch of philosophy that studies the nature of reality
- **Epistemology(认识论)**, The branch of philosophy that studies the nature and scope of knowledge



### A History of Philosophy 

[A History of Philosophy]() by Author F.Holmes from Wheaton Colleage is a series of 81 youtube videos that covers the topics from the very beginning of western philosophy until the very recent ones. The Course outline can be found [here]
