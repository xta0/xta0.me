## How does the Transformer model work at high level

The power of the transformer architecture lies in its ability to learn the relevance and context of all of the words in a sentence, not just the words next to its neighbors, but every other word in a sentence.

To apply attention weights to those relationships so that the model learns the relevance of each word to each other words no matter where they are in the input.

This gives the algorithm the ability to learn "who has the book", "who could have the book",

These attention weights are learned during LLM training. In the end, we will get something called "attention map"

In this example, you can see that the word book is strongly connected with the word `teacher` and the word `student`.

This is called self-attention and the ability to learn a tension in this way across the whole input significantly approves the model's ability to encode language
