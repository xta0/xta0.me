## The Transformer Architecture Overview

The power of the transformer architecture lies in its ability to learn the relevance and context of all of the words in a sentence, not just the words next to its neighbors, but every other word in a sentence.

We apply attention weights to those relationships so that the model learns the relevance of each word to each other words no matter where they are in the input. This gives the algorithm the ability to learn "who has the book", "who could have the book",

These attention weights are learned during LLM training. In the end, we will get something called "attention map"

In this example, you can see that the word book is strongly connected with the word `teacher` and the word `student`.

This is called self-attention and the ability to learn attention in this way across the whole input significantly approves the model's ability to encode language

The transformer architecture is split into two distinct parts, the encoder and the decoder.

- Encoder

  - Encodes inputs ("prompts") with contextual understanding and produces one vector per input token

- Decoder
  - Accepts input tokens and generates new tokens

### Inputs and embedding

The inputs are first converted to tokens(one-hot vectors) then passed to the embedding layer. This layer is a trainable vector embedding space, a high-dimensional space where each token is represented as a vector and occupies a unique location within that space. In the original transformer paper, the vector size was actually `512`.

For simplicity, if you imagine a vector size of just three, you could plot the words into a three-dimensional space and see the relationships between those words and calcuate the distance between those words.

Since the model processes each of the input tokens **in parallel**. We need to preserve the information about the word order and don't lose the relevance of the position of the word in the sentence. We do so by adding the positional encoding.

### Self attention

The self-attention weights that are learned during training and stored in these layers reflect the importance of each word in that input sequence to all other words in the sequence. But this does not happen just once, the transformer architecture actually has `multi-headed self-attention`.

This means that multiple sets of self-attention weights or heads are learned in parallel independently of each other. The number of attention heads included in the attention layer varies from model to model, but numbers in the range of 12-100 are common.

Each self-attention head will learn a different aspect of language. For example, one head may see the relationship between the people entities in our sentence. While another head may focus on the activity of the sentence.

It is important to note that we don't dictate ahead of time what aspects of language the attention heads will learn. The weights of each head are randomly initialized and given sufficient training data and time, each will learn different aspects of language.

### Feed foward + Softmax layer

The last two layers are feed forward and softmax.They are normalized into a probability score for each word. This output includes a probability for every single word in the vocabulary, so there's likely to be thousands of scores here.
