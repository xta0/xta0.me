Another effective technique for fine-tuning a model is enhancing the resolution of the generated image. Unlike traditional image upscaling methods that rely on simple interpolation, image super-resolution leverages advanced algorithms, often powered by deep learning. These models learn high-frequency patterns and details from a dataset of high-resolution images, enabling them to produce superior-quality results when applied to low-resolution images.
