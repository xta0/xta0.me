## Fine-tuning with human feedback(RLHF)

In 2020, researchers at OpenAI published a paper that explored the use of fine-tuning with human feedback to train a model to write short summaries of text articles

A popular technique to fine-tune large language models with human feedback is called <mark>reinforcement learning from human feedback, or RLHF for short</mark>.

<img class="md-img-center" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/2024/llm3-2.png">

## Reinforcement learning (RL) overview

Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning in which <mark>an agent learns to make decisions related to a specific goal by taking actions in an environment, with the objective of maximizing some notion of a cumulative reward.</mark>

<img class="md-img-center" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/2024/llm3-3.png">

In this framework, the agent continually learns from its experiences by taking actions, observing the resulting changes in the environment, and receiving rewards or penalties, based on the outcomes of its actions. By iterating through this process, the agent gradually refines its strategy or policy to make better decisions and increase its chances of success.
The series of actions taken by the model and corresponding states form a result, often called a <mark>rollout</mark>

## Reinforcement learning: fine-tune LLMs

<img class="md-img-center" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/2024/llm3-4.png">

- In the LLM world, the agent's policy that guides the actions is the LLM, and its objective is to generate text that is perceived as being aligned with the human preferences

- The environment is the context window of the model, the space in which text can be entered via a prompt

- The state that the model considers before taking an action is the current context. That means any text currently contained in the context window

- The action here is the act of generating text. This could be a single word, a sentence, or a longer form text, depending on the task specified by the user. <mark>The sequence of actions and states is called a rollout</mark>

- The action space is the token vocabulary, meaning all the possible tokens that the model can choose from to generate the completion

At any given moment, the action that the model will take, meaning which token it will choose next, <mark>depends on the prompt text in the context and the probability distribution over the vocabulary space</mark>. The reward is assigned based on how closely the completions align with human preferences.

One way you can do this is to have a human evaluate all of the completions of the model against some alignment metric, such as determining whether the generated text is toxic or non-toxic. This feedback can be represented as a scalar value, either a zero or a one. The LLM weights are then updated iteratively to maximize the reward obtained from the human classifier, enabling the model to generate non-toxic completions.

However, obtaining human feedback can be time consuming and expensive. <mark>As a practical and scalable alternative, you can use an additional model, known as the reward model, to classify the outputs of the LLM and evaluate the degree of alignment with human preferences</mark>.

You'll start with a smaller number of human examples to train the secondary model by your traditional supervised learning methods. Once trained, you'll use the reward model to assess the output of the LLM and assign a reward value

<mark>The reward model is the central component of the reinforcement learning process</mark>. It encodes all of the preferences that have been learned from human feedback, and it plays a central role in how the model updates its weights over many iterations

## Collecting human feedback

Starting with a fine-tuned LLM to generate some completions. Then we need to use human workforce to hand-pick the ones that we think meets the criteria.

<img class="md-img-center" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/2024/llm3-5.png">

This process then gets repeated for many prompt completion sets, building up a data set that can be used to train the reward model.

### Prepare labeled data for training

Once your human labelers have completed their assessments off the Prom completion sets, you have all the data you need to train the reward model

<img class="md-img-center" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/2024/llm3-6.png">

- In the example shown here, there are three completions to a prompt, and the ranking assigned by the human labelers was `2, 1, 3`, as shown, where `1` is the highest rank corresponding to the most preferred response.
- With the three different completions, there are three possible pairs purple-yellow, purple-green and yellow-green. Depending on the number `N` of alternative completions per prompt, you will have `N` choose `two` combinations
- For each pair, you will assign a reward of `1` for the preferred response and a reward of `0` for the less preferred response
- Then you'll reorder the prompts so that the preferred option comes first. This is an important step because the reward model expects the preferred completion, which is referred to as $Y_{j}$ first.

### Train the reward model

This reward model is usually also a language model. For example, a BERT that is trained using supervised learning methods on the pairwise comparison data that you prepared from the human labelers assessment above.

<img class="md-img-center" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/2024/llm3-7.png">

For a given prompt `X`, the reward model learns to favor the human-preferred completion $y_{j}$, while minimizing the loss sigmoid off the reward difference, $r_{j} - r_{k}$.

### Use the reward model

Once the model has been trained, you can use the reward model as a binary classifier to provide a set of logics across the positive and negative classes

## Fine-tuning with RLHF

Let's bring everything together, and look at how you will use the reward model in the reinforcement learning process to update the LLM weights, and produce a human aligned model.

<img class="md-img-center" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/2024/llm3-9.png">

- First, you'll pass a prompt from your prompt dataset. In this case, `a dog is`, to the instruct LLM, which then generates a completion, in this case `a furry animal`.
- Next, you sent this completion, and the original prompt to the reward model as <mark>the prompt completion pair</mark>
- The reward model evaluates the pair based on the human feedback it was trained on, and returns a reward value. A higher value such as `0.24` as shown here represents a more aligned response
- You'll then pass this reward value for the prom completion pair to the reinforcement learning algorithm to update the weights of the LLM, and move it towards generating more aligned, higher reward responses. Let's call this intermediate version of the model the <mark>RL updated LLM</mark>

These iterations continue for a given number of epics, similar to other types of fine tuning.

If the process is working well, you'll see <mark>the reward improving</mark> after each iteration as the model produces text that is increasingly aligned with human preferences. You will continue this iterative process until your model is aligned based on some evaluation criteria.

There are several RL algorithms that you can use for this part of the RLHF process. A popular choice is <mark>proximal policy optimization or PPO for short</mark>.
