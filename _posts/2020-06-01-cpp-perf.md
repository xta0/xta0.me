## CPU Caches

Small amounts of unusually fast memory.
- Gnererally hold contents recently accessed memory locations
- Access latency much smaller than for main memory

Three common types
- Data (D-cache)
- Instruction(I-cache)
- Translation lookaside buffer(TLB)
	- Caches virtual->real address translations

> Cache-lines are the key! Undoubtedly! If you will make even single error in data layout, you will get 100x slower solution! No jokes!

### Cache Hierarchies

Cache hierarchies are common.

E.g., Intel Core i7-9xx processor:
- 32KB L1 I-cache, 32 KB L1 D-cache per core
	- Shared by 2 HW threads
- 256 KB L2 cache per core
	- Holds both instructions and data
	- Shared by 2 HW threads
- 8MB L3 cache
	- Holds both instructions and data
	- Shared by 4 cores(8 HW threads)
