## CPU Caches

Small amounts of unusually fast memory.
- Gnererally hold contents recently accessed memory locations
- Access latency much smaller than for main memory

Three common types
- Data (D-cache)
- Instruction(I-cache)
- Translation lookaside buffer(TLB)
	- Caches virtual->real address translations
