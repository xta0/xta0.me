## Introduction to Attention

"One important property of human perception is that one does not tend to process a whole scene in its entriety at once. Instead, humans focus attention selectively on parts of the visual space to acquire information when and where it is needed, and combine information from different fixations over time to build up an internal representation of the scene, guiding future eye movements and decision making."
