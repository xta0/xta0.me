### The Four Stages of Compilation

<img class="md-img-center" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/2021/07/perf-4-1.png">

### Source Code to Assembly Code

Assembly language provies a convenient symbolic representation of machine code.

```c
int64_t fib(int64_t n){
    if(n < 2){
        return n;
    }
    return (fib(n-1) + fib(n-2));
}
```
We can do `clang -03 fib.c -S` to generate the assembly code, which gives the code like this

<img class="md-img-center" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/2021/07/perf-4-2.png">

From here, we assemble the assembly code to produce the binary. 

```shell
$clang fib.s -o -fib.o
```
Binary executable produced with debug symbols (compiled with `-g`) can be dumped using 

```shell
$objcdump -S fib
```

This will produce the disassembly of the machine code, which is more readable.

### Why Assembly?

Why botter looking at the assembly of your program?

- The assembly reveals what the compiler did and didnot do.
- Bugs can arise at a low level. For example, a bug inthe code might only have an effect when compilingat `â€“O3`. Furthermore, sometimes the compiler is thesource of the bug!
- You can modify the assembly by hand, when all elsefails.
- Reverse engineering: You can decipher what aprogram does when you only have access to itsbinary.

## X86-64 Instruction Set Architecture Primer

The instruction set architecture (ISA) specifies the syntax and semenatics of assemebly, which includes Registers, Instructions, Data types and Memory addressing modes.

<img class="md-img-center" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/2021/07/perf-4-4.png">

There are a bunch of x86-64 registers. The important ones are

<img class="md-img-center" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/2021/07/perf-4-5-1.png">

- The Flags register keeps tracking of whether there is a overflow. Or whether the last operation returns 0, etc.
- The instruction pointer register 
- The SSE and AVX registers are recently added.These are vector register for SIMD instructions.

The x86-64 general-purpose registers are **aliased**: each has multiple names, which refer to overlapping bytes in the register.

<img class="md-img-center" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/2021/07/perf-4-6.png">

Here are all the general purpose regiesters

<img class="md-img-center" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/2021/07/perf-4-7.png">

Some of them are still useful for a particular purpose, such as `rsp` is used as stack pointer, and `rbp` is used to point to the base of the frame.

## The x86-64 Instruction Format

Format: `<opcode> <operand_list>`

- `<opcode>` is a short mnemonic identifying the type of instruction
- `<operand_list>` is 0,1,2 or (rarely) 3 operands, seperated by commas.
- Typically, all oeprands are sources, and one operand might also be the destiniation.

<img class="md-img-center" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/2021/07/perf-4-7-1.png">

What does `<op> A, B` mean? There are two syntax standards namely AT&T Syntax and Intel Syntax. In the AT&T syntax, the second operand is the destination, whereas in the Intel syntax, the first operand is the destination.

<img class="md-img-center" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/2021/07/perf-4-8.png">

### The common x86-64 Opcodes

<img class="md-img-center" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/2021/07/perf-4-9.png">

Opcodes might be augmented with a suffix that describes the data type of the operation or a condition code.

- An opcode for data movement, arithmetic or logic uses a single-char suffix to inidicate the data type
- If the suffix is missing, it can usually be inferred from the sizes of the operand registers.

<img class="md-img-center" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/2021/07/perf-4-9-1.png">

### x86-64 Data Types

<img class="md-img-center" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/2021/07/perf-4-9-2.png">

### Conditional Operations

Condiional jumps and conditional moves use a one or two char suffix to indicate the condition code.

```c
cmpq $4096, %r14
jne .LBB1_1
```

In the example above, `ne` means the jump should only be taken if the argumetns of the previous comparision are not equal. The previous comparision result is stored in the RFLAG register. 

### RFLAGS Register

Arithmetic and logic operations update **status flags** in the RFLAGS register. Common RFLAGS register meanings are listed below

<img class="md-img-center" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/2021/07/perf-4-10.png">

Let take a look at an example

```c
decq %rbx // Decremetn %rbx, and set ZF if the result is 0.
jne .LBB7_1 // Jump to the label .LBB7_1 if ZF is not set
```

### Condition Codes

<img class="md-img-center" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/2021/07/perf-4-11.png">

Q: Why do the condition codes `e` and `ne` check the zero flag?
A: Hardware typically compares integer operands using subtraction.

### x86-64 Direct Addressing Modes

The operands of an instruction specify values using a variety of addressing modes. 

- At most one operand may specify a memory address. 

**Direct addressing modes**

- **Immediate**: Use the specified value. 
    - `movq $172, %rdi`
- **Register**: Use the value in the speicified register
    - `movq %rcx, %rdi`
- **Direct memory**: Ues the value at the specified memory address
    - `movq 0x172, %rdi`

Q: How many cycles of the machine does it typically take to fetch something from memory these days?
A: A coupel of hundreds. So clearly, if you can get things into registers, most registers you can access in a single cycle.

**Indirect Addressing modes**

The x86-64 ISA also supports indirect addressing: specifying a memory address by some computation

- **Register Indirect**: The address is stored in the specified register
    - `movq (%rax), %rdi`
- **Register indexed**: The address is a constant offset of the value in the specific register
    - `movq 172(%rax), %rdi`
- **Instruction-pointer relative**: The address is indexed relative to `%rip`
    - `movq 172(%rip), %rdi`

### Base Indexed Scale Displacement

The most general form of indirect addressing supported by x86-64 is the base indexed scale displacement mode.

<img class="md-img-center" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/2021/07/perf-4-12.png">

This mode refers to the address

```
Base + Index*Scale + Displacement
```

If unspecified, Index and Displacement default to 0, and Scale defaults to 1.

### Jump Instructions

The x86-64 jump instructions, `jmp` and `j<condition>`, take a `label` as their operand, which identifies a location in the code.

- Lables can be symbols, exact addresses, or relative addresses.
- An **indirect jump** takes as its operand an indirect address.
    - `jmp *%eax`

```shell
// example from fib.s
jge LBB0_1
...
LBB0_1:
    leaq -1(%rbx), %rdi

// example from objdump fib
jge 5 <_fib + 0x15>
...
15:
  leaq -1(%rbx), %rdi
```

### Assembly Idioms 1

The XOR opcode `xor A, B` computes the bitwise XOR of `A` and `B`. For example

Question: What does the following assembly do?

```shell
xor %rax, %rax
# zeors the register
```
Answer: Zeros the register

### Assembly Idioms 2

The test opcode `test A, B,` computes the bitwise AND of `A` and `B` and discard the result, preserving the RFLAGS register. For example, the code snippets below checks to see whether the register is 0. 

Question: What does the test instruction test for in the following assembly snippets?

```shell
test %rcx, %rcx
je 400c0a <mm+0xad> # jump to that address if %rcx holds 0

test %rax, %rax
cmovne %rax, %r8 # do the conditional move if %rax holds 0
```

Answer: Checks to see whether the register is 0.

### Assembly Idioms 3

The x86-64 ISA includes several no-op (no operation) instructions, including `nop`, `nop A` (no-op with an argument), and `data16.`

Question: What does this line of assembly do?

```shell
data16 data16 data16 nopw %cs:0x0(%rax, %rax,1)
# the instruction does nothing!
```
Answer: Nothing!

Question: Why would the compiler generate assembly with these idioms? 
Answer: Mainly to optimize instruction memory (e.g., code size, alignment)

### Floating-Point Instruction Sets

Modern x86-64 architectures support scalar (i.e., non-vector) floating-point arithmetic via a couple of different instruction sets

> The original 8086 did not have a floating-point unit. Floating point was done in software. And then they made a companion chip that would do floating point and later was integrated to the CPU. 

- The SSE and AVX Instructions support single-precision and double precision scalar floating-point arithmetic, i.e., `float` and `double`
- The x87 instructions support single-, double-, and extended-precision scalar floating-point arithmetic, i.e., `float`, `double`, and `long double`.

The SSE and AVX instruction sets also include vector instructions.

### Vector Instructions

Vector instructions generally operate in an elementwise fashion:

- The `i`th element of one vector register can only take part in operations with the `i`th element of the other vector registers
- All lanes perfom exactly the same operation on their respective elements of the vector
- Depending on the architecture, vector memory operands might need to be aligned, meaning their address must be multiple of the vector width.
- Some architectures support cross-lane operations, such as inserting or extracting subsets of vector elements, permuting the vector, scatter, or gather.

Modern x86-64 architectures support multiple vector-instruction sets

- Modern SSE instruction sets support vector operations aon integer, single-precision, and double-precision floating-point values.
- The AVX instructions support vector operations on single-precision, and double-precision floating point values
- The AVX2 instructions add integer-vector operations to the AVX instruction sets
- The AVX-512 instructions increase the register length to 512 bits and priovide new vector operations, including popcound.




## OVERVIEW OF COMPUTER ARCHITECTURE

A simple 5-stage processor

### Block Diagram of 5-Stage Processor

<img class="md-img-center" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/2021/07/perf-4-14.png">

Each instruction is executed through 5 stages:
1. Instruction fetch (IF): Read instruction from memory.
2. Instruction decode (ID): Determine which units to use to execute the instruction, and extract the register arguments.
3. Execute (EX): Perform ALU operations.
4. Memory (MA): Read/write data memory.
5. Write back (WB): Store result into registers.

### Architectural Improvements

Historically, computer architects have aimed to improve processor performance by two means: 
- Exploit parallelism by executing multipleinstructions simultaneously.
    - Examples: instruction-level parallelism(ILP), vectorization, multicore
- Exploit locality to minimize data movement.
    - Example: caching.
