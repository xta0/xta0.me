##  Data Structures

### Packing and Encoding

The idea of **packing** is to store more than one data value in a machine word. The related idea of **encoding** is to convert data values into a representation requiring fewer bits.

### Augmentation

The idea of data-structure augmentation is to add information to a data structure to make common operations do less work. 

Example: Appending singly linked lists

- Appending one list to another requires walking the length of the first list to set its null pointer to the start of the second.
- AUgmenting the list with a tail pointer allows appending to operate in a constant time.

## Logic

### Constant Folding and Propagation

The idea of constant folding and propagation is to evaluate constant expressions and substitue the result into further expressions, all during compilation.

```c
void orrery() {
    const double x = 1;
    const doube y = 2 * x;
    const double z = M_PI * y;
    //...
}
```
With a sufficiently high optimization level, all the expressions are evaluated at compile-time.

## Functions

### Inlining

The idea of **inlining** is to avoid the overhead of a function call by replacing a call to the function with the body of the function itself.

```c
double square(doube x) {
    return x*x;
}

double sum_of_squares(double* A, int n) {
    double sum = 0.0f;
    for (int i=0; i<n; ++i){
        sum += square(A[i]);
    }
    return sum;
}
```

We can inline the `square` function to reduce the overhead (stack expend). To do that, we can simply mark fucntion using `static inline` keywords. It turns out for some modern compilers, the functions can be inlined without declaring "static inline".
