### Clang/LLVM Compilation Pipeline

This lecture completes more of the story from Lecture 5 about the compilation process

### Why study the compiler optimizations?

- Compiler can have a big impact on software performance
- Compilers can save you performance-engineering work.
- Compilers help ensure that simple, readable, and maintainable code is fast
- You can understand the differences between the source code and the IR or assembly
- Compilers can make mistakes
- Understanding compilers can help you use them more effectively.

### Simple Model of the Compiler

An optimizing compiler performs a sequence of transformation passes on the code

```shell
LLVM IR -> Transform -> Transform -> Transform -> ... -> Transform -> Optimized LLVM IR
```

- Each transofrmation pass analyzes and edits the code to try to optimize the code's performance
- A transformation pass might run multiple times
- Passes run in a predetermined order that seems to work well most of the time

### Compiler Reports

Clang/LLVM can produce **reports** for many of its transformation passes, not just vectorization:

- `-Rpass=<string>`: Produces reports of which optimizations matching `<string>` were successful.
- `-Rpass-missed<string>`: Produces reports of which optimizations matching `<string>` were not successful.
- `-Rpass-analysis=<string>`: Produces reports of the analyses performed by optimizations matching `<string>`

The argument `<string>` is a regular expression. To see the whole report, use ".*" as the string.

The good news: The compiler can tell you a lot about what's doing

- Many transformation passes in LLVM can report places where they successfully transform code.
- Many can also report the conclusions of their analysis.

The bad news: Reports can be hard to understand.

- The reports can be long and use LLVM jargon.
- Not all transformation passes generate reports.
- Reports don't always tell the whole story.

We want context for understanding these reports
