<p>‚ÄúOne important property of human perception is that one does not tend to process a whole scene in its entriety at once. Instead, humans focus attention selectively on parts of the visual space to acquire information when and where it is needed, and combine information from different fixations over time to build up an internal representation of the scene, guiding future eye movements and decision making.‚Äù</p>

<p>The photo above is footage from a person wearing the eye-tracking device, where the orange circle is highlighting where the person is looking at each moment.The idea from computer vision researchers was to try to adopt a method that does that for computer vision models. In machine learning, attention methods give us a mechanism for adding selective focus into a machine learning model. Typically, one that does its processing sequentially.</p>

<p>Attention is a concept that powers up some of the best performing models spanning both natural language processing and computer vision.</p>
